Sourceless [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/15fvsqfwyr8o6xby?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/olerass/sourceless)
===

Sourceless is a no-fuss solution for reading/parsing & writing demo files produced by GoldSource (HL1) and
Source-engine (HL2) based games (e.g. Half-Life, Counter-Strike 1.6, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Team Fortress (1/2)).

It provides a clean API for reading and writing messages through the entire network
stack and is backed by a thorough test suite.

The ultimate goal is to support demo files produced by any version of the
GoldSource- and Source-engines, ranging from the first version of Half-Life
released in 1998 to the newest Source engine-based games on Steam.

### Status
Sourceless is in its infancy. The API, namespaces and structure may and probably will
change several times before settling down.
